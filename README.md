## The Problem

Language learning is often limited by static textbooks that offer a passive experience. Learners miss out on real-world conversational practice and real-time feedback, making the journey to fluency slow and uninspiring. Many traditional solutions lack personalization and adaptability, making language learning less engaging and effective.

## The Solution

**Resonant** addresses these challenges by embedding AI into every textbook:

- It **brings language to life** with interactive, immersive content.
- **Guides learners in real time** with personalized audio feedback.
- **Adapts dynamically** to provide relevant practice based on individual learner progress.

Unlike language apps that follow scripted lessons or audio platforms that lack interactivity, Resonant is about creating **dynamic learning experiences** that feel conversational, engaging, and effective.

## Roadmap

- **AI Tutor Mode**: Integrate an AI tutor mode where users can ask grammar-related questions and receive real-time answers, enhancing the learning experience beyond just the textbook content.

## Current And Future Technical Implementation

**Resonant** uses cutting-edge technologies to create a deeply interactive, personalized learning experience:

### Contextual Retrieval

Soon, we will employ **contextual retrieval** techniques to transform static textbooks into fully interactive learning tools. Inspired by [Anthropic's advancements in contextual retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), this technology allows Resonant to embed entire textbooks into a context-aware model. Learners can engage in dynamic conversations about any topic within their textbook—extending beyond simple language learning and turning the book into an interactive dialogue companion. This approach ensures that learners can get answers, insights, and practice on any subject matter, whenever they need it.

### Language Learning and Speech Technology

For **real-time speaking practice**, Resonant utilizes a combination of advanced technologies to make language learning both immersive and effective:

- **Eleven Labs API for Voice Synthesis**: By integrating the Eleven Labs API, Resonant generates natural-sounding voices tailored to user preferences. This makes practicing with the AI feel more personal and engaging, similar to practicing with a human tutor.
- **Speech Recognition and Real-Time Feedback**: Resonant employs advanced speech recognition to analyze user pronunciation in real time. Learners receive instant corrections and constructive feedback, allowing them to refine their speaking skills continuously. This feature replicates the value of having a tutor on hand to provide timely guidance during practice.

### Adaptive AI Models

To deliver a highly personalized learning experience, **Resonant** uses **large language models** that:

- **Track Progress**: The AI tracks each learner's progress, monitoring strengths and weaknesses to customize future lessons.
- **Generate Adaptive Responses**: Based on the learner's level, the model provides context-sensitive responses that make each interaction meaningful and effective. This adaptability ensures that learners are always being challenged just enough to promote growth without frustration.

These technologies form the core of Resonant, making textbooks **dynamic, personalized, and engaging**. Whether it’s practicing pronunciation, clarifying complex language rules, or exploring deeper content in real-time conversation, Resonant adapts to the learner's journey and makes the entire process interactive and effective.
