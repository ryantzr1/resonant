## The Problem

Language learning is often limited by static textbooks that offer a passive experience. Learners miss out on real-world conversational practice and real-time feedback, making the journey to fluency slow and uninspiring. Many traditional solutions lack personalization and adaptability, making language learning less engaging and effective.
